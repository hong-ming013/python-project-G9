This is our python project! :D

**Review Sentinment Analysis**

This is the python project for review sentiment analysis as part of INF1002 Programming Fundementals Project.

**Brief description of the project**

This project aims to analyze and classify sentences based on sentiment. The goal is to automatically determine whether a given
text expresses a positive, negative or neutral sentiment.

We built this project because sentiment analysis is a important problem in natural language processing (NLP). It can be applied
in many real-world scenarios, such as understanding customer feedback, analyzing product reviews, or gauging public opinion on
social media. By creating this project, we learned how to preprocess text, apply lexicon-based methods, and design a Python
program that classifies sentiments effectively.

**Features**

Process input text
Preprocess module to tokenize / remove stopwords
Classify sentiment as positive/negative/neutral
WEB UI to submit reviews
